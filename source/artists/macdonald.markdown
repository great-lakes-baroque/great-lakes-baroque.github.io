Heralded for his "impressive and stylistically Scottish playing" ([Melinda Crawford](http://www.melindacrawford.com/)),
Tim Macdonald is a regular performer, composer, and teacher of Scottish-Baroque music. The reigning US National Scottish
Fiddling Champion (and the first to win the title on a Baroque violin), Tim has performed with [Rachel Barton
Pine](http://classical.rachelbartonpine.com/), [Jeremy Ward](http://www.jeremydavidward.com), and [Colyn
Fischer](http://www.scotsduo.com/), among others.  He made his New York debut in a sold-out performance at the Frick
Collection as a guest soloist with acclaimed Baroque group [Trio Settecento](http://www.triosettecento.com/), and he has
also appeared with the Trio on WQXR classical radio. A scholar as well as a player, Tim is an Arthur and Lila Weinberg
Fellow at the [Newberry Library](http://newberry.org/), where he will be researching the period-correct performance of
Scottish-Baroque music, focusing on the works of Robert Mackintosh.  He also plays the viola d'amore, harpsichord, and concertina, develops software, and
recently ran the Chicago Marathon for charity.
