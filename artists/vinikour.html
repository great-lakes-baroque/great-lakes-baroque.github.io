<p>Two time Grammy&reg; Award nominated harpsichordist Jory Vinikour is recognized as
one of the outstanding musicians of his generation. A highly diversified career
brings him to the world&rsquo;s most important festivals and concert halls as recital
and concerto soloist, and partner to several of today&rsquo;s finest artists.</p>

<p>Born in Chicago, Jory Vinikour studied in Paris with Huguette Dreyfus and
Kenneth Gilbert on a Fulbright scholarship. First Prizes in the International
Harpsichord Competitions of Warsaw (1993) and the Prague Spring Festival (1994)
brought him to the public&rsquo;s attention, and he has since appeared in festivals
and concert series throughout much of the world.</p>

<p>In repertoire ranging from Bach to Poulenc to Nyman, Jory has performed as
soloist with the Rotterdam Philharmonic, Orchestre de la Suisse Romande,
Lausanne Chamber Orchestra, Philharmonic of Radio France, Ensemble Orchestral
de Paris, Netherlands Chamber Orchestra, MDR Symphony Orchestra, Cape Town
Symphony Orchestra, Moscow Chamber Orchestra, and the Royal Scottish National
Orchestra, with conductors such as Stéphane Denève, Martin Haselböck, Marek
Janowski, Armin Jordan, Benjamin Levy, Fabio Luisi, Marc Minkowski, John
Nelson, Gordan Nikolic, Constantine Orbelian, Victor Yampolsky, <em>et al.</em></p>

<p>Well-known as an accompanist, he has worked extensively with artists such as
David Daniels, Hélène Delavault, Vivica Genaux, Magdalena Kozena, Annick
Massis, Marijana Mijanovic, Dorothea Röschmann, Rolando Villazon&hellip; He has
accompanied legendary Swedish mezzo-soprano Anne Sofie von Otter in recitals in
Sweden, Norway, Spain and Paris and at La Scala in Milan. With lutenist Jakob
Lindberg, their programme of English and Italian music of the 17th century,
entitled <em>Music for a While</em> was released by Deutsche Grammophon in early 2005.</p>

<p>As an active exponent of contemporary repertoire for the harpsichord, he has
given the premieres of works by composers such as Harold Meltzer and Frédéric
Durieux, Stephen Blumberg, Patricia Morehead, Graham Lynch, etc.  written for
him. He has also given important performances of works by Gyorgy Ligeti and
Michael Nyman, as well as several 20<sup>th</sup> century concerti, including Cyril
Scott’s 1937 <em>Harpsichord Concerto</em>, which Mr. Vinikour prepared and edited for
Novello editions.</p>

<p>Mr. Vinikour appears regularly as harpsichordist at the finest opera houses and
festivals in Europe: Paris Opera, Netherlands Opera, Salzburg Festival, Teatro
Real de Madrid, Baden-Baden, Glyndebourne, etc. in Baroque and Classical
repertoire, as well as in more contemporary works (notably Stravinsky&rsquo;s <em>The
Rake&rsquo;s Progress</em> and Zimmermann&rsquo;s <em>Die Soldaten</em>) and is heard on many recordings
from Deutsche Grammophon, EMI, Erato, Sony Classics <em>et al.</em></p>

<p>His recording of Bach&rsquo;s <em>Goldberg Variations</em>, released on Delos International in
2001 received excellent reviews throughout the world. John von Rhein of the
Chicago Tribune named it as one of 2001&rsquo;s top ten classical CD&rsquo;s, an honor that
was also accorded to Mr. Vinikour’s recording of Bach&rsquo;s Toccatas in 1999. Mr.
Vinikour’s 2009 Delos release of Handel&rsquo;s 1720 Suites for Harpsichord has
received wide critical acclaim (American Record Guide naming it the finest
recording of these works). His debut recording for Sono Luminus, the complete
harpsichord works of Jean-Philippe Rameau, was nominated for a Grammy&reg; award,
in the category of Best Classical Solo Instrumental Recording in 2013. His
follow-up recording, <em>Toccatas</em> (Contemporary American works for harpsichord)
received the same honor this year.</p>

<p>Mr. Vinikour has appeared as conductor/soloist with the Hong Kong Philharmonic,
Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, Musica Angelica, Korea Chamber Orchestra,
musicAeterna, Juillard415, Alabama Symphony. Jory Vinikour is Artistic Director
and co-founder of Great Lakes Baroque in Milwaukee, and is Artistic Director of
