<p>The career of internationally-acclaimed harpsichordist and conductor <b>Jory Vinikour</b> has taken him to date from his native 
Chicago to performance venues on five continents. Following studies in Paris with Huguette Dreyfus and Kenneth Gilbert as a 
Fulbright scholar, garnering First Prizes in the Warsaw and Prague Spring Festival International Harpsichord Competitions catapulted 
him to public attention.</p>
<p>As a concert artist, Jory’s repertoire ranges from the Baroque works that are harpsichordists’ typical fare to masterworks of the 
Twentieth Century and music for harpsichord by Twenty-First-Century composers, several of whom have written works specially for him. 
He has worked with a number of the world’s leading orchestras and conductors, including performances under the batons of Marek Janowski,
Armin Jordan, Fabio Luisi, Marc Minkowski, John Nelson, and Constantine Orbelian.</p>
<p>Equally celebrated as a recital accompanist and vocal coach, Jory has shared stages with artists of the calibre of David Daniels, 
Vivica Genaux, Magdalena Kožená, Annick Massis, Anne Sofie von Otter, Dorothea Röschmann, and Rolando Villazón. Jory’s work as a 
continuo player and répétiteur has found him taking part in much-discussed productions in many of the world’s greatest opera houses and 
concert halls.</p>
<p>Recent theatrical engagements include harpsichord continuo for Telemann’s <i>Don Quichotte auf der Hochzeit des Comacho</i> with 
Chicago’s Haymarket Opera and musical preparation for Salzburger Festspiele’s August 2015 production of Gluck’s <i>Iphigénie en 
Tauride</i> with Cecilia Bartoli, Rolando Villazón, and Christopher Maltman. His association with Les Musiciens du Louvre Grenoble is 
documented on several critically-lauded recordings. Among many recordings of Baroque and Classical operatic repertory, hiis continuo 
playing is heard on Deutche Grammophon’s recording of Mozart’s <i>Die Entführung aus dem Serail</p> with Chamber Orchestra of Europe 
and Yannick Nézet-Séguin and will also distinguish the label’s forthcoming account of Le nozze di Figaro, recorded in concert in July 
2015.</p>
<p>Alongside successful recordings of Bach’s Goldberg Variations, Toccatas, and Sonatas for flute and harpsichord, in the last of which
he was partnered by Cleveland Orchestra principal flautist Joshua Smith, and Händel’s 1720 Suites for harpsichord, Jory’s recordings of 
the complete harpsichord works of Jean-Philippe Rameau and <i>Toccatas</i>, a disc of modern American music for harpsichord, received 
GRAMMY® nominations for Best Classical Instrumental Solo.</p>
<p>In September 2015, Jory took part in Great Lake Baroque's inaugural performance, and November 2015 found him in Norway for 
performances of Benjamin Britten’s <i>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</i> with Bergen National Opera and a special ‘Symfonisk maraton’ 
concert in which he co-directed the Bergen Filharmoniske Orkester. In December 2015, he was heard in New York in a sold-out solo 
recital at Carnegie Hall.</p>
<p>Jory will make his début as a conductor of opera with a production of Händel’s <i>Agrippina</i> for West Edge Opera in Berkeley, 
California, in August 2016.</p>
