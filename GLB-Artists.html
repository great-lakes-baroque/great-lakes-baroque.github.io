<p>The career of internationally-acclaimed harpsichordist and conductor <b>Jory Vinikour</b> has taken him to date from his native 
Chicago to performance venues on five continents. Following studies in Paris with Huguette Dreyfus and Kenneth Gilbert as a 
Fulbright scholar, garnering First Prizes in the Warsaw and Prague Spring Festival International Harpsichord Competitions catapulted 
him to public attention.</p><br/>
<p>As a concert artist, Jory’s repertoire ranges from the Baroque works that are harpsichordists’ typical fare to masterworks of the 
Twentieth Century and music for harpsichord by Twenty-First-Century composers, several of whom have written works specially for him. 
He has worked with a number of the world’s leading orchestras and conductors, including performances under the batons of Marek Janowski,
Armin Jordan, Fabio Luisi, Marc Minkowski, John Nelson, and Constantine Orbelian.</p><br/>
<p>Equally celebrated as a recital accompanist and vocal coach, Jory has shared stages with artists of the calibre of David Daniels, 
Vivica Genaux, Magdalena Kožená, Annick Massis, Anne Sofie von Otter, Dorothea Röschmann, and Rolando Villazón. Jory’s work as a 
continuo player and répétiteur has found him taking part in much-discussed productions in many of the world’s greatest opera houses and 
concert halls.</p><br/>
<p>Recent theatrical engagements include harpsichord continuo for Telemann’s <i>Don Quichotte auf der Hochzeit des Comacho</i> with 
Chicago’s Haymarket Opera and musical preparation for Salzburger Festspiele’s August 2015 production of Gluck’s <i>Iphigénie en 
Tauride</i> with Cecilia Bartoli, Rolando Villazón, and Christopher Maltman. His association with Les Musiciens du Louvre Grenoble is 
documented on several critically-lauded recordings. Among many recordings of Baroque and Classical operatic repertory, hiis continuo 
playing is heard on Deutche Grammophon’s recording of Mozart’s <i>Die Entführung aus dem Serail</i> with Chamber Orchestra of Europe 
and Yannick Nézet-Séguin and will also distinguish the label’s forthcoming account of <i>Le nozze di Figaro</i>, recorded in concert in July 
2015.</p><br/>
<p>Alongside successful recordings of Bach’s Goldberg Variations, Toccatas, and Sonatas for flute and harpsichord, in the last of which
he was partnered by Cleveland Orchestra principal flautist Joshua Smith, and Händel’s 1720 Suites for harpsichord, Jory’s recordings of 
the complete harpsichord works of Jean-Philippe Rameau and <i>Toccatas</i>, a disc of modern American music for harpsichord, received 
GRAMMY® nominations for Best Classical Instrumental Solo.</p><br/>
<p>In September 2015, Jory took part in Great Lake Baroque's inaugural performance, and November 2015 found him in Norway for 
performances of Benjamin Britten’s <i>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</i> with Bergen National Opera and a special ‘Symfonisk maraton’ 
concert in which he co-directed the Bergen Filharmoniske Orkester. In December 2015, he was heard in New York in a sold-out solo 
recital at Carnegie Hall.</p><br/>
	    <p>In December 2017, Jory débuted with the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra, conducting and playing harpsichord in three performances of music by Arcangelo Corelli, Benedetto Marcello, Giuseppe Torelli, and Antonio Vivaldi featuring oboist Jelena Dirks and mandolinist Avi Avital.</p><br/>
<p>Jory made his début as a conductor of opera with a production of Händel’s <i>Agrippina</i> for West Edge Opera in Berkeley, 
California, in August 2016. He followed this by leading Chicago Opera Theater’s production of Henry Purcell’s <i>Fairy Queen</i> in November 2016. Capitol Opera Richmond’s production of Mozart’s <i>Bastien und Bastienne</i> took Jory to Virginia’s capital city to conduct performances in February and March 2017. Future plans including leading Florentine Opera’s double bill of John Blow’s <i>Venus and Adonis</i> and Purcell’s <i>Dido and Aeneas</i> in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in January 2018, in collaboration with Great Lakes Baroque.</p><br/>
	    <p>In November 2016, Jory celebrated the release of his new Sono Luminus recording of Johann Sebastian Bach’s Partitas for solo harpsichord (BWV 825 - 830), expanding a discography that includes critically-acclaimed titles. Jory's Sono Luminus recordings <i>Toccatas</i> and <i>The Complete Harpsichord Works of Rameau</i> were nominated for GRAMMY® awards for Best Classical Instrumental Solo. Forthcoming recordings include Sonatas for violin and harpsichord by Johann Sebastian Bach, featuring Jory with his Great Lakes Baroque recital partner Rachel Barton Pine.</p><br>
	    <p>In addition to Great Lakes Baroque's and Florentine Opera's co-production of Blow's <i>Venus and Adonis</i> and Purcell's <i>Dido and Aeneas</i>, 2018 engagements include Jory’s début with The Cleveland Orchestra, with which ensemble he will perform Francis Poulenc’s <i>Concert champêtre</i>.</p><br>

<p>After simultaneously studying harpsichord with Kenneth Gilbert at the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique de Paris, where 
he was awarded a <i>premier prix</i>, and earning a degree in musicology at the Sorbonne, gifted harpsichordist, organist, and 
musicologist <b>Philippe LeRoy</b> continued his studies with revered pedagogue Huguette Dreyfus. In addition to special studies under 
the tutelage of Early Music pioneer Gustav Leonhardt, he participated as an honors student in the prestigious and competitive 
postgraduate department of the Paris Conservatory, the <i>Troisième cycle/cycle de perfectionnement</i>, in which he took part in the 
fortepiano class of Patrick Cohen.</p><br/>
<p>An organ student of Olivier Latry and scholar of Baroque organ repertoire under the supervision of Gilbert and Leonhardt, 
Philippe has participated in several respected European institutions’ summer courses, including Sienna’s Accademia Musicale Chigiana, 
Académie musicale de Villecroze, and Académie musicale de clavecin de Clisson. In 1998, he received the top prize of the International 
Harpsichord Competition in Warsaw, followed in 2000 by victory in the Twelfth Bach Competition in Leipzig, where he was also awarded 
the Mitteldeutscher Rundfunks Special Audience Prize.</p><br/>
<p>Philippe has been heard in performance as a solo harpsichordist throughout Europe, and as an organist specializing in Baroque 
repertoire he favors French, Spanish, and Italian music of the Sixteenth through Eighteenth Centuries. He has performed on France 
Musique/Radio France on several occasions, and his début recording was sponsored by the French Association for Artistic Action (now 
Culture France) as part of their series <i>Declic</i>, dedicated to young French winners of international music competitions. From 
that start, his subsequent recordings have received numerous accolades: his 2007 recording of the rarely-heard complete works of 
Armand-Louis Couperin on the Syrius label was named Best Instrumental Recording of the Year by online magazine <i>NewOlde.com</i>, and 
his recordings of J. S. Bach’s concerti for two and four harpsichords under the direction of Didier Talpain and virtuoso sonatas by 
Sebastián de Albero and Padre Antonio Soler were welcomed with rave reviews. Philippe's and Jory's recording of Padre Antonio Soler's Six Concerti for Two Keyboards was released on the Delos label on 12 August 2016.</p><br/>
<p>Philippe shares his encyclopedic knowledge of and affection for Baroque repertory with the Great Lakes region by serving as GLB's 
Director of Programming.</p><br/>
